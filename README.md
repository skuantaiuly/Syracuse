# Syracuse
## The Syracuse Sequence

The Syracuse (Collatz or Hailstone) conjecture concerns a sequence of integers defined as follows:

Starts with any positive integer N 

&nbsp;&nbsp;And each term is formed from the previous one as follows:
        
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the previous term is odd:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the next term is 3 times the previous term and plus 1 

$$
                3*N + 1
$$

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the previous term is even:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the next term is half the previous term

$$ 
                N / 2
$$
    
The sequence will always reach 1. üèÅ
